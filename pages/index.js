            welcome to my newly created portfolio
          </h1>

            Hi, i'm Háº¡nh, 25 years old, this is my portfolio page, i'm currently
            looking for a job, and learning to reactJS, so this site was
            originally made in plain html and css, so i decided to write it in
            react, it's not looking good by any mean, but i really took the time
            to make it.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm font-normal text-gray-800'>
            I don't know what to write here so i'll leave you be. Ah yes, i know
            photoshop, my english speaking is good too. My toeic score is 680,
            it was a long time ago, now i definitely get higher than that.
          </p>
