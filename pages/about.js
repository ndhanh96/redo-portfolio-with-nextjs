          Hi, i'm Háº¡nh, 25 years old, this is my portfolio page, i'm currently
          looking for an internship job, and learning to reactJS, so this site
          was originally made in plain html and css, so i decided to write it in
          react, it's not looking good by any mean, but i really took the time
          to make it, so please consider.
        </p>
        <p className='text-sm font-normal text-gray-800'>
          I always give my best to learn new things, trying to be a good
          front-end developer. I have some knowledge about mechanic but haven't
          touch it for a very long time.
        </p>
